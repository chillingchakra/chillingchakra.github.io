      <description>Hello.
I&amp;rsquo;m Mulder and this is Scully
She believes baby Yoda is cute as fuck.
I believe he is in fact so because Disney engineered him that way.
A: Oh my god, he issss cutttee! M: Yeah, sure he is, but isn&amp;rsquo;t it possible he is that way to all of us is because someone worked really hard to have all our minds thinking that in unison. A large scale operation by a corporation with a lot of money and the ability to hire anyone to do anything under sun and under the auspices of research and development for targeting audiences and give the guy free reign in terms of whatever his past experiments in some place that doesn&amp;rsquo;t care have lead him to discover.</description>

      <description>I went to go get rotisserie chicken from Ralphs today.
 I was like this is what I&amp;rsquo;m doing after work Laundry Shower to clean my hair up a bit Shave my neck area and then I&amp;rsquo;m walking to Ralphs and getting a rotisserie chicken and afterwards hitting the funky little liquor store that sells damn near everything and getting the beer.  I arrived to find all the rotisserie chickens had been taken.</description>
