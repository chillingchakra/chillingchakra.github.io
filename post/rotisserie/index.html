      <p>I went to go get rotisserie chicken from Ralphs today.</p>
<ol>
<li>I was like this is what I&rsquo;m doing after work</li>
<li>Laundry</li>
<li>Shower to clean my hair up a bit</li>
<li>Shave my neck area</li>
<li>and then I&rsquo;m walking to Ralphs and getting a rotisserie chicken and afterwards hitting the funky little liquor store that sells damn near everything and getting the beer.</li>
</ol>
<p>I arrived to find <strong>all the rotisserie chickens had been taken.</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a less Ralphsy Ralphs here in Chatsworth. So I went up to the dude at the counter and he was like we&rsquo;re done cooking for the day and I was like alright lemme look around.</p>
<p>The guy was 28, I could tell. Usually I can&rsquo;t tell quite so well but this guy was 28 for sure.  I ended up still wanting hot food so I asked him what that stuff on the left was since half the stuff was gone under the heat lamps, and he&rsquo;s like that carnitas.  I&rsquo;m like okay so basically white people eat everything up at Ralphs and leave the Carnitas completely untouched for the whole day where it&rsquo;s just floating in old oil. I was like okay dude, how do I order here, and he&rsquo;s like you get this container and he showed me this little piece of shit Ralphs container, and I&rsquo;m like how much is that thing and he&rsquo;s like $6.99. I&rsquo;m like alright, Fucking Ralphs, charging like this food is the good shit that its not, fine. I asked him if I could get that and the other 3 out of 8 remaining items which were potato wedges and mashed potatoes and mac and cheese and he hesitated like heaven forbid <em><strong>THE MAN</strong></em>  find out that we&rsquo;re mixing shit in a little container that isn&rsquo;t even translucent. It took him a minute to consider how hard <em><strong>THE MAN</strong></em> might come down on him (so he&rsquo;s also an egotistical pussy in my mind at this point, but whatever, balance the pros and cons man, do your thing, I&rsquo;ll wait.).</p>
<p>Finally he&rsquo;s like alright yah I can do that, in a whisper that couldn&rsquo;t have been heard because nobody was behind me nor was there seemingly any human being within 10 feet of either of us in this Chatsworth mini-fuck Ralphs.</p>
<p>So finally I got the shit and then I had to deal with the self checkout machine, not because I wanted to. I avoid them because it&rsquo;s apparent to me that stoners and old people use them and get all mixed up with the options happening on these things, which is valid. The menu design is about as well designed as an ATM machine from the 1980s that also offers you cubes you can click on that allow you to simply read useless information but not actually do anything.</p>
<p>I did it because Ralphs has notoriously slow lines as they&rsquo;ve noticed why have more than 3 cashiers open cause we&rsquo;re a Ralphs in Chatsworth and some bean counter did the math and he figured okay, we just don&rsquo;t need to spend that money for a fourth person. Also it was the sort of Ralphs where old white people go where they think if they&rsquo;ve seen the cashier more than two times combined in their lives they need to have a conversation with them about their spouse/children/grandparents/school prospects/fitness goal plans and other some shit that doesn&rsquo;t fucking belong in discussions at the checkout lane. People need to realize that if they care that much that they ask the person out on a friend date, or invite them to a get together that you&rsquo;re having with their friends if you really wanna ask them about their lives.</p>
<h2 id="part-two">Part two</h2>
<h6 id="the-liquor-store">the liquor store.</h6>
<p>I go into this liquor store and there are four Stella chalices glued to this promotional plaque that says if you buy a six pack of Stellas you get the chalice for only 1 cent, I&quot;m like down, I&rsquo;ll pepper this shit by never cleaning it after any beer and create a true chalice that is all grungy and never cleaned and made for otherwise boring beers like Stella. The cashier whom I&rsquo;ve seen working there is also 28, this one makes it evident in the way he talks like he&rsquo;s half a rapper but it&rsquo;s committed to the idea but just the talk even though he&rsquo;s just a young Persian kid. Whatever, I tell him about the Chalice and he has no idea what I&rsquo;m talking about and then he&rsquo;s like oh yah, don&rsquo;t worry about that, they just never took it down, and I&rsquo;m thinking well why don&rsquo;t you just give me one of the fucking glasses then for one cent, anyway, I didn&rsquo;t get a fucking glass but I hope he has a glass out of niceness ready for me after they take that fucking thing down or I&rsquo;m going back for my glass and suggesting I help take it down and get all four of the glasses glued with the plastic</p>
